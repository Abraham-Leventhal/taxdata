- Files related to current extrapolation routine in SAS, fortran and Excel can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/llaisso557ppf3f/AABexU9ELw5BHpNB3fVRuFxEa?dl=0). 
- The stage I and II python scripts are respectively stored the folders of same name. The stage I script is able to produce two files, Stage I factors and Stage II targets, and save them in the
Stage II folder. The Stage II script, currently for 16 years of extrapolation, takes in the factors and targets from stage I and generates the final weights for Tax-Calculator. You can
